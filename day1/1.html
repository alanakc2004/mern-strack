                INTRODUCTION: The Agricultural Research Station Mannuthy,  
                was started in the year 1957 as the Rice Research Station , 
                Mannuthy in the then Central Farm, Ollukkara, with administrative 
                control vested with Rice Specialist. Kerala Agricultural University
                 (KAU) was established in the year  1972 and the Station was taken 
                 over  from the State Department of Agriculture and brought under 
                 the control  of Kerala Agricultural University. Consequently,
                  Rice Research Station and Agricultural Research Station, Mannuthy were merged in the year 1976. The station was renamed as Agricultural Research Station,  Mannuthy in 1983 and since then it is functioning as an independent station.
